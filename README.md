# nefis-python
NEFIS is a library of functions designed for scientific programs. These programs are characterised by their large volume of input and output data. NEFIS is able to store and retrieve large volumes of data on file or in shared memory. To achieve a good performance when storing and retrieving data, the files are self-describing binary direct access files.
